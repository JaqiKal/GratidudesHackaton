<details><b><summary>#### Feature</b></summary>

The website features three main web pages:

-   **The landing page**, central to the user experience, this page invites users to share their gratitude by posting messages. Each submission becomes part of 'The Wall', a dynamic display of positive sentiments from the community.
-   **The About Page**, offers insights into the "The Great Gratitude Walls" platform and its team members.
-   **The Contact Page**, designed for users to make inquiries or seek assistance, featuring a straightforward form that, upon submission, employs EmailJS to ensure messages are promptly directed to the site administrators.

There are two auxiliary pages:

- The **404 Page Not Found** is a crucial auxiliary page designed to handle instances where a user attempts to access a non-existent section of the website. This page serves not only as a notification of an incorrect or outdated link but also as a gentle guide back to the main content, ensuring users don't feel lost.

- Upon submitting the contact form, users are directed to the **Thank You page**, another essential support page that acknowledges their action with gratitude. This page plays a pivotal role in the user interaction cycle by confirming that their message has been successfully sent and is under consideration. It reinforces the platform's community-driven ethos by expressing appreciation for the user's input or inquiry. Additionally, it reassures users that their effort to reach out is valued, with an inviting option to return to the main wall, encouraging continued participation in the platform's positive exchange of messages.
    
Key Features Include:

- **Message Submission with Validation** 

Users are encouraged to share their gratitude messages through a form. The system checks for prohibited words to maintain the content's positivity and requires all fields to be filled before submission, promoting responsible community interaction.

- **Persistent Message Display**

Utilizing local storage, messages once posted are stored and displayed even after the page is reloaded, ensuring the permanence of the gratitude expressed.

- **Dynamic Interaction**

The site integrates a 'like' button for each message, allowing users to interact with and acknowledge others' posts, fostering a supportive environment.

- **Post Management**

 Beyond adding messages, users can also remove their posts, giving them control over their contributions to the wall.

While the site currently does not feature a searchable database or commenting system, its existing framework lays the groundwork for potential expansions, including these and other interactive elements. The clear and concise error handling, alongside a custom 404 page and a thank-you page for form submissions, ensures a smooth user experience.

Through these carefully designed features and a commitment to a positive community ethos, 'The Great Wall of Gratitude' serves as a beacon of appreciation and kindness in the digital landscape."

### Accessibility

Accessibility is a core consideration for "The Great Wall of Gratitude". Our platform is designed to be accessible to users with diverse needs, ensuring everyone can participate in sharing gratitude. We enhanced our website's accessibility by adopting several strategies:

-   Implementing semantic HTML to structure content meaningfully.
-   Adding hover states to buttons for visual feedback during navigation.
-   Selecting sans serif fonts, which are easier for dyslexic users to read.
-   Utilizing aria-labelledby attributes and others to aid screen reader users in interacting with dynamic content.
-   Styling interactive elements with :hover and :focus in CSS for better keyboard navigation.
-   Employing CSS media queries and a flexible grid layout to accommodate various devices, including those with screen magnifiers.
-   Relying on textual content and CSS for design, improving accessibility for users with assistive technologies.

## Development Process

The development of our project follows a structured yet flexible approach, ensuring that we can adapt to changes and feedback while maintaining progress towards our goals. Our methodology emphasizes collaboration, iterative development, and a high degree of transparency both within the development team and with our stakeholders.

For details please visit our project team slack [Canvas](/documentation/canvas/hackaton-world-happiness-teamGratiDudes-Canvas.pdf) and our [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/VCGithubCode/projects/3)

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#content)</span>*

### Agile Methodology

Our project uses Agile methodology, a framework that enables us to respond to the unpredictability of building software through incremental, iterative work cadences, known as sprints. This approach fosters adaptability and encourages a rapid and flexible response to change, which is vital in the dynamic environment of software development.

At the start of each sprint, our team engages in sprint planning to set the direction

for our upcoming work, involving prioritization of the product backlog to address the most critical tasks first, defining clear sprint goals aligned with project milestones, and assigning tasks based on expertise and workload. Throughout development, we navigate trade-offs between scope, quality, time, and resources to maintain a balance between delivering high-quality work efficiently and managing priorities. Adopting Agile methodologies allows us to remain adaptable and focused, ensuring we meet user needs while striving for excellence.

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#content)</span>*

 ### Collaboration Tools
 
The team used [Slack](https://slack.com/) for quick collaboration purposes and Github projects to track User Stories, Bugs and Time plan.

The Team used slack team channel Canvas to ensure everyone stayed updated on project progress and discussions, see [GratiDudes Canvas](/documentation/canvas/hackaton-world-happiness-teamGratiDudes-Canvas.pdf)

### Programming Paradigms

The script utilizes a mix of paradigms to structure the logic for managing user interactions and data storage for a message board application, emphasizing sequence, modularity, and responsiveness to events.

#### Imperative Programming

The script directly specifies a sequence of operations to execute in order to achieve a desired outcome. This is seen in how functions are structured: a series of steps to manipulate the DOM based on user input or actions, such as adding a post to the display or filtering out prohibited words.

#### Procedural Programming

A subset of imperative programming, this paradigm organizes code into reusable procedures or functions. The script embodies this through defined functions like generatePost, addRecentMessage, and addToLocalStorage, which modularize the code for specific tasks, enhancing readability and maintainability.

#### Event-Driven Programming

This paradigm is centered around the handling of user-generated events. The script demonstrates this through the use of event listeners (addEventListener) that trigger specific functions (handleAddButton, initializeAddUserMessage) when the user interacts with the UI, such as clicking buttons or submitting a form.

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#content)</span>*

## Testing

We performed continuous manual testing of our site while developing it.
Validation of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is OK.

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#content)</span>*

#### Obtaining EmailJS API 

1. Sign up for a [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/) account in the EmailJS website.
2. Create an email service in your EmailJS dashboard.
3. Install EmailJS Library. You can do this by including the EmailJS script in your HTML file or by installing it via npm if you're using a package manager like npm or yarn.

```
npm install --save @emailjs/browser
```

or

```
$ yarn add @emailjs/browser
```

4. In your EmailJS dashboard, navigate to the "API Keys" section and copy your API key.
5. Add this code snippet before your closing tags. Making sure you have added your public key.

```js
<script type="text/javascript"
        src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@emailjs/browser@4/dist/email.min.js">
</script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  (function(){
      emailjs.init({
        publicKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
      });
  })();
</script>
```

6.  Create an email template in your EmailJS dashboard. This template will define the content and structure of the emails you'll send.
7. Write JavaScript function to send email using EmailJS. Below is a basic syntax for the code: 

```
emailjs.send(serviceID, templateID, templateParams, options);
```

8. Call your function whenever you want to send an email.
